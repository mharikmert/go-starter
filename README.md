# Stephen Grider's Go Course

This repository contains my study, solutions to the exercises and projects throughout <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/go-the-complete-developers-guide/">Stephen Grider's Go course on Udemy</a>. The course covers the fundamentals of Go programming, including:

- Basic syntax and data types
- Control flow and loops
- Functions and return values
- Structs and pointers
- Interfaces
- Maps
- Concurrency, goroutines, and channels

## Getting Started

To run the code in this repository, you'll need to have Go installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of Go from the official website: https://golang.org/dl/

Once you have Go installed, you can clone this repository and navigate to the project directory in your terminal. From there, you can run the `go run` command to execute any of the `.go` files in the project.

## Course Outline

The course is divided into several sections, each covering a different aspect of Go programming. Here's a brief overview of what you can expect to learn in each section:

1. Getting Started: Installing Go and setting up your development environment.
2. Basic Syntax: Variables, constants, data types, and control flow.
3. Functions: Defining and calling functions, function parameters and return values.
4. Structs and Pointers: Creating custom data types and working with structs and pointers.
5. Interfaces: Defining interfaces and implementing them in Go.
6. Maps: Creating and working with maps in Go.
7. Concurrency: Goroutines, channels, and synchronization in Go.
