ASSIGNMENT #1

Write a program that creates two custom struct types called 'triangle' and 'square'.

The 'square' type should be a struct with a single field, 'sideLength' of type float64.

The 'triangle' type should be a struct with a single field, 'height' of type float64 and 
a single field called 'base' of type float64.

Both types should have a function called 'getArea' that returns the calculated area of the 
square or triangle.

Area of a triangle = 0.5 * base * height
Area of a square = sideLength * sideLength

Add a 'shape' interface that defines a function called 'printArea'. This function should
calculate the area of the given shape and print it out to the terminal.
Design the interface so that the 'printArea' function can be called with either a triangle or a square.







ASSIGNMENT #2

Create a program that reads the content of a text file and then prints its content to the terminal.

The file to open should be provided as an argument to the program when it is executed at the terminal. 
For example 'go run main.go myfile.txt' should open up myfile.txt and print out its content to the terminal.

To read in the arguments provided to a program, you can reference the variable 'os.Args'. which is a []string 

To open a file, check out the documentation for the 'Open' function in the 'os' package.

What interfaces does the 'File' type implement?

In the 'File' type implements the Reader interface you might be able to reuse that io.Copy function.
